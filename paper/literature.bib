- Look up Burgess and Marshall 2011
- A relatively new, extremely powerful model that falls into this class is the integral projection model (IPM) (Easterling et al. 2000). These models allow the dynamics of continuous phenotypic character distributions to be tracked. Matrix models are appropriate to study the dynamics of discrete characters, like age or genotype at a single locus (Caswell 2001), with IPMs providing the continuous character equivalent. Generalised IPMs allow a mixture of both discrete and continuous characters to be modelled (Rees and Ellner 2009). The reason that structured models like IPMs and matrix models are so powerful is that all populations are structured by a mix of discrete and continuous characters. The statistics that population ecologists and evolutionary biologists use always describe some aspect of a character distribution or its dynamics, so it is unsurprising that these statistics can be calculated from models of the dynamics of character distributions (Coulson et al. 2010).
- The type of models I construct are structured models -- individuals can be categorised into discrete classes (Caswell 2001), or positioned at a point along some continuum (Easterling et al. 2000). Individuals in different classes or positions along the continuum have different rates of survival, reproduction and development.
- Good for discussing the model "does reasonable well" "and serves purpose of informing improvement of which function would improve the model predictions?"

For example, an ecological change such as a change in plant community structure that alters the distribution of seed sizes available for birds to eat can lead to evolutionary change; for example, a shift in the heritable component of mean beak size [2] (ecology-to-evolution pathway). This evolutionary change in the bird population can in turn elicit an ecological change by increasing the size of the bird population [2] (evolution-to-ecology pathway), resulting in a feedback loop that many biologists assume is ubiquitous [1].}

annote = {- The general argument is as follows: Many studies have documented that ecological change affects evolution; indeed, natural selection is where ecology and evolution meet. Such studies of ``evolution in action,'' i.e., over observable time scales, show that evolution can be very rapid. This opens the possibility that evolutionary dynamics can also affect ecology; specifically, evolution can occur so quickly that ecological and evolutionary change may be commensurate in time and may interact in a feedback loop.
- The number of reliable studies in which natural selection has been observed has increased markedly since Endler reviewed them in his classic 1986 book, Natural Selection in the Wild. The most compre- hensive discussions are by Reznick and colleagues (4, 6), who found 47 studies demonstrating or imply- ing rapid evolution for a variety of traits (morpho- logical, physiological, life-history, phenological, and behavioural).
- Evolution can be fast {\ldots} By definition, observations of evolution in action document extremely rapid evolution. The num- ber of reliable studies in which natural selection has been observed has increased markedly since Endler reviewed them in his classic 1986 book, Natural Selection in the Wild.
- These reinterpretations of how quickly evo- lution can occur open the door to the possibility that evolutionary dynamics can affect ecological dynamics---in principle. We have just seen that, be- cause evolution can be so fast (4, 6, 8), evolutionary and ecological time can be commensurate. Indeed, natural selection and population dynamics are both affected by births and deaths of individuals (12--14).
- Ezard et al. (18) recently used the Hairston et al. methodology to partition pop- ulation change for five ungulate species. They characterize the evolutionary (morphological var- iables) versus ecological (vegetational and climatic variables) contributions as ``statistically indistin- guishable'' (Fig. 2). Indeed, the best supported model includes both evolutionary and ecological factors, as well as the interaction between them.
-  what is the contribution to population growth of evolution- ary factors, such as genetically based phenotypic change, relative to ecological factors such as changes in the predation or resource regime or abiotic environmental change?
- Hairston et al: In the finch G. fortis discussed above (2), evolutionary contributions (via beak shape and body size) exceeded ecological contributions (via seed density and fraction of large seeds) by a factor of 2.2. For Hairston et al.'s data on the copepod Onychodiaptomus sanguineus, the evolutionary contribution (via life history: whether diapausing or immediately hatching eggs are produced) was one-fourth the ecological contri- bution (via fish predation), which they call ``less than in the finch example, but nevertheless sub- stantial.'' They also applied a related method to Abrams and Matsuda's (17) model of predator- prey dynamics, showing that evolutionary effects are substantial but not dominant, being 63% of ecological effects.

However, in island biogeography, as is the case with many strands of non-experimental biology, numerous factors can cause this assumption to be violated (see Table 1 for examples of non-independence in the island biogeography literature). The problem of non-independence of data becomes particularly acute when researchers consider larger datasets in a quest for statistical power and model generality. In this paper, we show that linear mixed modelling (LMM) can address these issues by adding information on the structure of the data (e.g. pseudoreplication due to multiple data points coming from the same island, archipelago or taxon).}
